What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	A .git file is created (containing ??) but no git repository commit is made. I guess this initialises the structure required to create git commits in the new repository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	It offers a way to select which files in the working directory will be a part of the commit into the repository. So it represents a sub-set of the files in the working directory.
